title: Back to the blog.

Today I saw a repository in my github that I didn't recognize and found out it's a blog I forgot I had created in summer of 2017.  How did I forget about that?  I read all the posts and realized there is a lot about programming that I knew back then and can't recall now.  The blog lasted only about a month, so I guess I must've learned all that stuff that summer.  That gives me hope that I can get more proficient with my coding abilities in the next month or so.

Once again I'm on the market for an industry job.  I joined Erd√∂s Institute and right now I'm doing the data visualization minicourse.  The plan was to create a repository for it that contains my solutions to the problem sets and my project.  That's what brought me to my github page today.  I think I might have to do a lot of cleaning up to do.  Let's see how this goes.
