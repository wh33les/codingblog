title: Git for Windows and command lines.
---
Been awhile!  Last semester was way busier than I was anticipating, but I'm trying to make a better time management plan for this spring.

To start, I wanted Git for Windows on my work computer.  So far the process has been different from what I remember about how I got it on my personal computer.  To get it on my personal computer I used Erd&ouml;s Institute's instructions and downloaded it from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  For my work computer, it was several days ago, I think what I did was a Bing search (I thought I should use Microsoft Edge on my work computer, I guess because it has the whole Microsoft Office suite and I thought just using all Microsoft products would be easier as long as I have them?) and downloaded it from [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/).  From what I can tell, the downloads are the same--

__UPDATE:  This post was going to be about how I can use Git in the command line on my personal computer but not on my work computer, and what I was going to do about it.  Turns out I _can_ use Git in the command line on my work computer, I just wasn't in the right directory!  I feel silly, but at least I've been assured that the universe does make sense.__

OK, but something else I wanted to explore with Git for Windows.  The download comes with Git Bash, which I think is an emulator for Bash, the command line on Linux operating systems.  I am not at all proficient with Linux, it seems like this is a good opportunity to learn a little.  Alternatively, I have in my to-do list of skills to build, getting more familiarity with the Windows command line.  Right now I know just enough to push to and pull from my Github repositories.  Could I work on both?
