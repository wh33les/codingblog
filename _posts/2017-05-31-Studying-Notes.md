!I used the settings on this [webpage by The Hyperbolics](http://www.hyperbolics.caths.cam.ac.uk/main.php?section=people&ID=1) for my Anki flashcards.  TIL that factorials dominate powers of 10 when _n_=25. I also L the updated way to align images in html. Before, I was using the attribute `align="right"`.  It is now `class="wrap align-right"`, where the specifications are in the css style file.  How do you make smart quotes in Markdown?  In this case I was able to just nest them in a code environment.
